Description: Implements likelihood inference for early epidemic analysis. BETS is short for the four key epidemiological events being modeled: Begin of exposure, End of exposure, time of Transmission, and time of Symptom onset. The package contains a dataset of the trajectory of confirmed cases during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) early outbreak. More detail of the statistical methods can be found in Zhao et al. (2020) <arXiv:2004.07743>.
